This repository contains T-SQL scripts, PowerShell code, and command files that are used to create various reports within the GLFHC IT communiuty.  
Most of these files were run as part of SQL jobs from the DBA Workstation and generated reports that were emailed to recipients.  Howerver, they can be run from other servers, if needed.  

Sending an emila requires a username and password (which is encrypted).  So, these parameters need to be changed in the code for it to work properly.
